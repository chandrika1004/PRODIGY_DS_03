# PRODIGY_DS_03
This repository contains Task_03 of Data Science Internship under Prodigy InfoTech. In this task I used a Decision Tree to predict if a customer will say yes or no to a bank offer. I used a dataset with deatils like age, job and contact type. I cleaned the data, explored it using graphs and trained the model. Then I tested it to see how well it worked.
